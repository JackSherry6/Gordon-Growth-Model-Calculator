# Gordon-Growth-Model-Calculator
App to analyze stocks future values based on dividends using the Gordon Growth Model

## Description

This program features an application that calculates the future value of any stock in the yfinance library using the Gordon Growth Model. This model takes into account historical stock values, historical stock dividends, systemic risk of the stock, and current market values based on the S&P500. Because this model assumes a constant growth rate, it is best used for well established companies with stable growth rates. The application utilizes the tkinter library for a basic user interface. The backend of the program utilizes the yfinance, requests, and BeautifulSoop libraries for web-scaping all of the stock and market data. 

## How to install and use this program

1. Clone this project
2. Make sure you have the correct libraries installed (tkinter, requests, BeautifulSoop and yfinance)
3. Run Gordon_Growth_Model_Calculator.py in any code editor
